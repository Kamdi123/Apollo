Kindly note that the resources within the *Data Resources* folder are based on my personal research. If you encounter any other resources that seem better or more reliable, you are free to discard my resources list or you could communicate it to me and have my list updated; I welcome updates sincerely.

The [*Data analysis track*](https://github.com/Acemma78/Data_Roadmap/blob/master/Analysis.md#a-skills-needed) is a prerequisite to the Data [Science](https://github.com/Acemma78/Data_Roadmap/blob/master/Science.md#data-science-track) track. Kindly note that the there was a "Data Engineering" roadmap, but it was removed due to my inability to source and organise what i consider *proper* resources; with time and experience, the roadmap will be updated.

After completing the *Excel for Business/Data Visualization with Tableau course*, you can proceed to try out the [KPMG data analytics virtual internship](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/theme/m7W4GMqeT3bh9Nb2c/KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual-Internship) or other vivrtual internships or bootcamps you come across, to put your new found skills to the test. 

Feel free to reach out in case you have any questions or if you simply just want to have a conversation; I also intend on making friends during this journey.
